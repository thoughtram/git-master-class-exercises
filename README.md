## Rewording the Commit Message in the middle of a series

###The scenario

Imageine you have prepared a series of commits. You crafted meaningful commits where each commit groups a logically related chunk of work. You are just about to push it all into the shared repository but then...
You noticed that you made a typo in the commit message of the commit in the middle of the series.

Take a look at the commit messages:

FIRST COMMIT: This is the first commit.

SECOND COMMIT: This is se second commit.

THIRD COMMIT: This is the third commit.

Notice how we screwed up the second commit message? This is called a *phonetic typo*. It happens to me all the time. Let's fix that real quick.

What we want is:

FIRST COMMIT: This is the first commit.

SECOND COMMIT: This is the second commit.

THIRD COMMIT: This is the third commit.
