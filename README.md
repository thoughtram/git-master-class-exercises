## Amending the last commit

###The scenario

You just made a commit in a local branch that you didn't share with anybody yet. Right after the moment
that you commited (surprise, surprise) you notice that you made a small typo in your changes.

Because you didn't share your changes with anybody yet, it is safe to just amend the previous commit
so that the typo will never make it into any public history.

The file in question is `scenario.md` and the typo is in the second word which should be corrected from
*browwn* to *brown*
